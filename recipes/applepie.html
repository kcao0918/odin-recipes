    <h2>Description</h2>
    <body>
        This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me several first place prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your favorites as well! Serve hot or cold at family dinners or during the holidays, topped with whipped cream or ice cream, or alongside a slice of Cheddar cheese.

        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Pie Crust</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the filling: On the stove, make a paste with flour and butter. Add the sugar and water and bring to a boil. Simmer, then remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Assemble the pie: Press one crust into a pie plate. Place the sliced apples on the bottom crust. Use the top crust to make a lattice crust according to the recipe below. Pour the butter-sugar mixture over the lattice crust.</li>
        <li>Bake the pie: Bake the pie in a preheated oven until the apples are soft and the crust is golden brown.</li>
